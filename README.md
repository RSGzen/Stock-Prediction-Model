How To Use The Program?

> Preprocessess.ipynb is only for preprocessing and feature selection purposes which are not related to the actual machine learning model

> main.ipynb is the main file which consists everything for the stock prediction model
- Dataset download source
- Data cleansing
- Data split
- Model builds
- Model training
- Model testing
- Model testing into more unseen data

> The "models" file consist of ML models that are trained and tested which provided the best results
- Just rerun the whole jupyter notebook file to see the results of the trained models

> To train new models
- At the first block of code, you can just change the names of models to generate and save new ones!!!
